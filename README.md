# TripCalculation
Driver trip calculation



Read the data from input.txt using Buffer Reader
After that I used two class Driver and Trip to perform the required calculation
From the first lines of data we create the required no driver depend on the input
Based on the input data which I get based on that I will create the trip class object
By using the trip class object I calculate the total Miles and MPH in application class.
